TODO:
- refetch on subsequent subcription (using deduping though)
- conditional fetch on `null` keys?
- mutator
- (possibly that will require map/set changes):
  - add document.focus event handler
  - add blur + reconnect event handler + interval

ideas for future:
1. steal some ideas from here: https://swr.vercel.app/docs/api#options
2. events (global and isolated to a single store)
